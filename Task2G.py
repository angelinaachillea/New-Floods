#build a set of data of the stations risk of flooding 
#whichever are most at risk of flooding then use that list and relate to the towns in which they flow through
#to get the rate of flooding use the fraction of over usual flow rate as given in exercise 2B
#that will give the risk of flooding if you take anything at 0.8 and below as low risk,0.8-1.2 medium risk,1.2-2 high risk, 2+severe
#with all these scores for the stations (0,1,2,3) add them up for all the rivers in the area,
